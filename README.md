This is a tool for teachers to build lesson plans for students. 
I used the openAI completion API for generating fields to populate a lesson plan. 
For the frontend I used material UI with React.
I spent about 2 days on this particular project.

Future improvements:
More fine-tuning capabilities for teachers. 
Ability to request multiple open ai requests
Improved visualizations.

This is a tool for teachers to build lesson plans for students.  
I used the openAI completion API for generating fields to populate a lesson plan.  
For the frontend I used material UI with React.  
I spent about 2 days on this particular project.  

Future improvements:  
More fine-tuning capabilities for teachers.   
Ability to request multiple open ai requests  
Improved visualizations.
